🍷 Wine Quality Prediction
📖 Project Overview
Wine quality is influenced by a variety of chemical properties — from acidity to density. In this project, we use machine learning classifiers to predict wine quality based on these chemical characteristics. It’s a practical example of how data science can be applied to viticulture and product evaluation.

🎯 Goals
Explore the dataset of wine samples with chemical attributes

Understand how features like density, acidity, and alcohol content affect wine quality

Train and compare three classifier models:

Random Forest

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)

Support Vector Classifier (SVC)

Visualize patterns and model performance

Provide insights into which features most strongly influence wine quality

🛠️ Key Steps (Short & Humanized)
Load the Data → Bring in the wine dataset

Clean & Explore → Handle missing values, check distributions, and understand chemical features

Pick Features → Focus on attributes like acidity, density, alcohol, etc.

Train Models → Apply Random Forest, SGD, and SVC classifiers

Evaluate Performance → Use accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports

Visualize Results → Show feature importance, correlations, and prediction outcomes

📚 Learning Objectives
